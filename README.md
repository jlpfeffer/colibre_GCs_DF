# COLIBRE GCs dynamical friction
Dynamical friction scripts for COLIBRE GCs. Built to run with HBT+ subhalo catalogues.

First, dynamical_friction.py is run across all simulation snapshots to generate dynamical friction catalogues for star clusters. Next, join_df_files.py is run to propagate disruption of clusters from earlier to later snapshots.
